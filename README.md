**MindTrial** lets you test a single AI language model (LLM) or evaluate multiple models side-by-side. It supports providers like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Mistral AI, xAI, Alibaba, Moonshot AI, and OpenRouter. You can create your own custom tasks with text prompts, plain text or structured JSON response formats, optional file attachments, and tool use for enhanced capabilities; validate responses through exact value matching or an LLM judge for semantic evaluation; and get results in easy-to-read HTML and CSV formats.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Install the tool:

   ```bash
   go install github.com/CircleCI-Research/MindTrial/cmd/mindtrial@latest
   ```

2. Run with default settings:

   ```bash
   mindtrial run
   ```

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.25](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for tool execution)
- API keys from your chosen AI providers

## Key Features

- Compare multiple AI models at once
- Create custom evaluation tasks using simple YAML files
- Attach files or images to prompts for visual tasks
- Enable tool use for tasks with secure sandboxed execution
- Use LLM judges for semantic validation of complex and creative tasks
- Get results in HTML and CSV formats
- Easy to extend with new AI models
- Smart rate limiting to prevent API overload
- Interactive mode with terminal-based UI

## Basic Usage

1. Display available commands and options:

   ```bash
   mindtrial help
   ```

2. Run with custom configuration and output options:

   ```bash
   mindtrial --config="custom-config.yaml" --tasks="custom-tasks.yaml" --output-dir="./results" --output-basename="custom-tasks-results" run
   ```

3. Run with specific output formats (CSV only, no HTML):

   ```bash
   mindtrial --csv=true --html=false run
   ```

4. Run in interactive mode to select models and tasks before starting:

   ```bash
   mindtrial --interactive run
   ```

## Configuration Guide

MindTrial uses two simple YAML files to control everything:

### 1. config.yaml - Application Settings

Controls how MindTrial operates, including:

- Where to save results
- Which AI models to use
- API settings and rate limits

### 2. tasks.yaml - Task Definitions

Defines what you want to evaluate, including:

- Questions/prompts for the AI
- Expected answers
- Response format rules

> [!TIP]
> **New to MindTrial?** Start with the example files provided and modify them for your needs.

> [!TIP]
> Use **interactive mode** with the `--interactive` flag to select model configurations and tasks before running, without having to edit configuration files.

### config.yaml

This file defines the tool's settings and target model configurations evaluated during the trial run. The following properties are required:

- **output-dir**: Path to the directory where results will be saved.
- **task-source**: Path to the file with definitions of tasks to run.
- **providers**: List of providers (i.e. target LLM configurations) to execute tasks during the trial run.
  - **name**: Name of the LLM provider (e.g. *openai*).
  - **client-config**: Configuration for this provider's client (e.g. *API key*).
  - **runs**: List of runs (i.e. model configurations) for this provider. Unless disabled, all configurations will be trialed.
    - **name**: A unique display-friendly name to be shown in the results.
    - **model**: Model name must be exactly as defined by the backend service's API (e.g. *gpt-4o-mini*).
    - **disable-structured-output**: Disable structured JSON responses for this run and force plain-text answers.
      When enabled, MindTrial:
      - treats the model's entire response as the **final answer** (title and explanation are filled with placeholders)
      - forces the model to use plain-text response mode
      - skips tasks that require schema-based (`response-result-format`) JSON outputs
    - **text-only**: Skip tasks that require file attachments (e.g. images).
      When enabled, only tasks without file attachments will be executed.
      This is useful for text-only models that cannot process images or other files.

> [!TIP]
> Use `text-only` for models that do not support vision capabilities, such as text-only language models hosted on platforms like OpenRouter.

> [!TIP]
> If the model can output JSON *as plain text* but cannot follow a provider-enforced schema, prefer `text-response-format`. Use `disable-structured-output` only when the model cannot reliably output JSON at all.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For models that accept an explicit `response-format` parameter (e.g. OpenRouter), ensure the response format is unset or set to plain text when `disable-structured-output` is enabled; otherwise the run will fail.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `disable-structured-output` flag cannot be used in judge configurations, as judges require structured responses for evaluation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All provider names must match exactly:
>
> - **openai**: OpenAI GPT models
> - **google**: Google Gemini models
> - **anthropic**: Anthropic Claude models
> - **deepseek**: DeepSeek open-source models
> - **mistralai**: Mistral AI models
> - **xai**: xAI (Grok) models
> - **alibaba**: Alibaba (Qwen) models
> - **moonshotai**: Moonshot AI (Kimi) models
> - **openrouter**: OpenRouter-hosted models

> [!NOTE]
> **Anthropic** and **DeepSeek** providers support configurable request timeout in the `client-config` section:
>
> - **request-timeout**: Sets the timeout duration for API requests (i.e. thinking).
>
> **Alibaba** and **Moonshot AI** providers support endpoint configuration in the `client-config` section:
>
> - **endpoint**: Specifies the network endpoint URL for the API. If not specified, defaults are:
>   - **Alibaba**: *Singapore* endpoint (`https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`) for better international access. For *China* mainland, use `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`.
>   - **Moonshot AI**: Public API endpoint (`https://api.moonshot.ai/v1`).

> [!NOTE]
> Some models support additional model-specific runtime configuration parameters.
> These can be provided in the `model-parameters` section of the run configuration.
>
> Currently supported parameters for **OpenAI** models include:
>
> - **text-response-format**: If `true`, use plain-text response format (less reliable) for compatibility with models that do not support `JSON`.
> - **reasoning-effort**: Controls effort on reasoning for reasoning models. (values: `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`). Legacy models may not support all values.
> - **verbosity**: Controls how many output tokens are generated. (values: `low`, `medium`, `high`). May not be supported by legacy models.
> - **temperature**: Controls randomness/creativity of responses (range: 0.0 to 2.0, default: 1.0). Lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs.
> - **top-p**: Controls diversity via nucleus sampling (range: 0.0 to 1.0, default: 1.0). Lower values produce more focused outputs.
> - **presence-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on their presence in text so far (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0). Positive values encourage model to use new tokens.
> - **frequency-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on their frequency in text so far (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0). Positive values encourage model to use less frequent tokens.
> - **max-completion-tokens**: Controls the maximum number of tokens available to the model for generating a response.
>
> Currently supported parameters for **OpenRouter** models include:
>
> - **response-format**: Controls response format (values: `json-schema`, `json-object`, `text`, default: `json-schema`). MindTrial adjusts its parsing logic based on this value, so always use this typed parameter rather than passing `response_format` directly (see note below about extra parameters).
> - **temperature**: Controls randomness/creativity of responses (range: 0.0 to 2.0, default: 1.0). Lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs.
> - **top-p**: Controls diversity via nucleus sampling (range: 0.0 to 1.0, default: 1.0). Lower values produce more focused outputs.
> - **top-k**: Limits token selection to top K candidates (range: 0 or above, default: 0). Value 0 disables this setting.
> - **min-p**: Filters tokens below minimum probability relative to most likely token (range: 0.0 to 1.0, default: 0.0).
> - **top-a**: Considers tokens with sufficiently high probability relative to most likely token (range: 0.0 to 1.0, default: 0.0).
> - **presence-penalty**: Penalizes token repetition based on presence in input (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0).
> - **frequency-penalty**: Penalizes token repetition based on frequency in input (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0).
> - **repetition-penalty**: Reduces repetition of tokens from input (range: 0.0 to 2.0, default: 1.0).
> - **max-tokens**: Sets upper limit on generated tokens (range: 1 or above, limited by model context).
> - **seed**: Enables deterministic sampling when supported.
> - **parallel-tool-calls**: Enables parallel function calling during tool use (default: true).
> - **verbosity**: Controls response verbosity (values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, default: `medium`).
>
> Any additional parameters not listed above can be specified directly in `model-parameters` and will be forwarded to the OpenRouter API. Use for provider-specific or OpenRouter-specific parameters. Prefer typed parameters where they exist. Note: if both a typed parameter and an equivalent extra parameter are specified (e.g., `max-tokens: 100` and `max_tokens: 500`), the extra parameter takes precedence and the API will receive the extra parameter's value.
>
> Currently supported parameters for **Anthropic** models include:
>
> - **max-tokens**: Controls the maximum number of tokens available to the model for generating a response.
> - **thinking-budget-tokens**: Enables extended thinking with a fixed token budget, giving the model more reasoning capacity on complex tasks. Must be at least 1024 and less than `max-tokens`. Ignored when `effort` is also set. If neither is set, extended thinking is disabled.
> - **effort**: Enables adaptive extended thinking and guides how deeply the model reasons before responding, from quick answers (`low`) to thorough multi-step reasoning (`max`) (values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`). If neither is set, extended thinking is disabled. When set, `thinking-budget-tokens` is ignored. Use `max-tokens` to cap total output (thinking + response text).
> - **temperature**: Controls randomness/creativity of responses (range: 0.0 to 1.0, default: 1.0). Lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs.
> - **top-p**: Controls diversity via nucleus sampling (range: 0.0 to 1.0). Lower values produce more focused outputs.
> - **top-k**: Limits tokens considered for each position to top K options. Higher values allow more diverse outputs.
> - **stream**: If `true`, enables streaming mode for the API response. Streaming is recommended for requests with large `max-tokens` values, especially when extended thinking is enabled, to prevent HTTP timeouts on long-running requests. Responses are streamed incrementally and buffered internally before processing.
>
> Currently supported parameters for **Google** models include:
>
> - **text-response-format**: If `true`, use plain-text response format (less reliable) for compatibility with models that do not support `JSON`. This setting applies to all tasks, including those with and without tools enabled.
> - **text-response-format-with-tools**: If `true`, forces plain-text response format when tools are enabled (required for pre-Gemini 3 models). If `false` or unset, uses JSON schema mode with tools (Gemini 3+ default behavior). This setting only applies to tasks with tools enabled.
> - **thinking-level**: Controls the maximum depth of the model's internal reasoning process (values: `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`). Gemini 3 Pro defaults to `high` if not specified. `minimal` minimizes reasoning for lowest latency (does not guarantee thinking is disabled), `low` minimizes latency and cost for simple tasks, `medium` balances reasoning depth and latency, while `high` maximizes reasoning depth for complex tasks (the model may take longer but output is more carefully reasoned).
> - **media-resolution**: Controls the maximum number of tokens allocated per input image (values: `low`, `medium`, `high`). Higher resolutions improve fine text reading and small detail identification but increase token usage and latency. `low` uses 280 tokens; `medium` uses 560 tokens; `high` uses 1120 tokens. If unspecified, the model uses optimal defaults.
> - **temperature**: Controls randomness/creativity of responses (range: 0.0 to 2.0, default: 1.0). Lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs. For Gemini 3, it's recommended to keep temperature at default 1.0 for optimal reasoning performance.
> - **top-p**: Controls diversity via nucleus sampling (range: 0.0 to 1.0). Lower values produce more focused outputs.
> - **top-k**: Limits tokens considered for each position to top K options. Higher values allow more diverse outputs.
> - **presence-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far. Positive values discourage reuse of tokens, increasing vocabulary. Negative values encourage token reuse.
> - **frequency-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on their frequency in the text so far. Positive values discourage frequent tokens proportionally. Negative values encourage token repetition.
> - **seed**: Seed used for deterministic generation. When set, the model attempts to provide consistent responses for identical inputs.
>
> Currently supported parameters for **DeepSeek** models include:
>
> - **temperature**: Controls randomness/creativity of responses (range: 0.0 to 2.0, default: 1.0). Lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs.
> - **top-p**: Controls diversity via nucleus sampling (range: 0.0 to 1.0). Lower values produce more focused outputs.
> - **presence-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on their presence in text so far (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0). Positive values encourage model to use new tokens.
> - **frequency-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on their frequency in text so far (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0). Positive values encourage model to use less frequent tokens.
>
> Currently supported parameters for **Mistral AI** models include:
>
> - **temperature**: Controls randomness/creativity of responses (range: 0.0 to 1.5). Lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs.
> - **top-p**: Controls diversity via nucleus sampling (range: 0.0 to 1.0). Lower values produce more focused outputs.
> - **max-tokens**: Controls the maximum number of tokens available to the model for generating a response.
> - **presence-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on their presence in text so far (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0). Positive values encourage model to use new tokens.
> - **frequency-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on their frequency in text so far (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0). Positive values encourage model to use less frequent tokens.
> - **random-seed**: Provides the seed to use for random sampling. If set, requests will generate deterministic results.
> - **prompt-mode**: When set to "reasoning", instructs the model to reason if supported.
> - **safe-prompt**: Enables content filtering to ensure outputs comply with usage policies.
>
> Currently supported parameters for **xAI** models include:
>
> - **temperature**: Controls randomness/creativity of responses (range: 0.0 to 2.0, default: 1.0). Lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs.
> - **top-p**: Controls diversity via nucleus sampling (range: 0.0 to 1.0, default: 1.0). Lower values produce more focused outputs.
> - **max-completion-tokens**: Controls the maximum number of tokens available to the model for generating a response.
> - **presence-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on their presence in text so far (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0). Positive values encourage model to use new tokens.
> - **frequency-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on their frequency in text so far (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0). Positive values encourage model to use less frequent tokens.
> - **reasoning-effort**: Controls effort on reasoning for supported reasoning-capable models (values: `low`, `high`). Not all xAI reasoning models (i.e. Grok 4) accept this parameter.
> - **seed**: Integer seed to request deterministic sampling when possible. Determinism is best-effort. xAI makes a best-effort to return repeatable outputs for identical inputs when `seed` and other parameters are the same.
>
> Currently supported parameters for **Alibaba** models include:
>
> - **text-response-format**: If `true`, use plain-text response format (less reliable) for compatibility with models that do not support `JSON` (for example, when thinking is enabled on certain Qwen models).
> - **stream**: If `true`, enables streaming mode for the API response. Some models (e.g. QwQ, QVQ, and Qwen-Omni) require streaming to be enabled. Responses are streamed incrementally and buffered internally before processing.
> - **temperature**: Controls randomness/creativity of responses (range: 0.0 to 2.0, default: 1.0). Lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs.
> - **top-p**: Controls diversity via nucleus sampling (range: 0.0 to 1.0). Lower values produce more focused outputs.
> - **max-tokens**: Controls the maximum number of tokens available to the model for generating a response.
> - **presence-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0). Positive values encourage introducing new topics.
> - **frequency-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on their frequency in text so far (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0). Positive values encourage model to use less frequent tokens.
> - **seed**: Makes text generation more deterministic by using the same seed value. When using the same seed and keeping other parameters unchanged, the model makes best-effort to return consistent outputs for identical inputs.
> - **disable-legacy-json-mode**: Compatibility toggle that controls legacy prompt injection for JSON formatting. Default: `false` (legacy mode on), which adds an explicit JSON formatting instruction to the prompt for improved compatibility with most Qwen models. Setting this to `true` disables the legacy prompt injection. For best compatibility and reliable JSON responses, keep this set to `false` unless you are certain the target model works correctly without legacy prompt injection.
>
> Currently supported parameters for **Moonshot AI** models include:
>
> - **temperature**: Controls randomness/creativity of responses (range: 0.0 to 1.0, default: 0.0). Higher values make output more random, while lower values make it more focused and deterministic. Moonshot AI recommends 0.6 for `kimi-k2` models and 1.0 for `kimi-k2-thinking` models.
> - **top-p**: Controls diversity via nucleus sampling (range: 0.0 to 1.0, default: 1.0). Lower values produce more focused outputs. Generally, change either this or temperature, but not both at the same time.
> - **max-tokens**: Controls the maximum number of tokens to generate for the chat completion.
> - **presence-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the text (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0). Positive values increase the likelihood of the model discussing new topics.
> - **frequency-penalty**: Penalizes new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text (range: -2.0 to 2.0, default: 0.0). Positive values reduce the likelihood of the model repeating the same phrases verbatim.

> [!NOTE]
> The results will be saved to `<output-dir>/<output-basename>.<format>`. If the result output file already exists, it will be replaced. If the log file already exists, it will be appended to.

> [!TIP]
> The following placeholders are available for output paths and names:
>
> - **{{.Year}}**: Current year
> - **{{.Month}}**: Current month
> - **{{.Day}}**: Current day
> - **{{.Hour}}**: Current hour
> - **{{.Minute}}**: Current minute
> - **{{.Second}}**: Current second

> [!TIP]
> If `log-file` and/or `output-basename` is blank, the log and/or output will be written to the `stdout`.

> [!NOTE]
> MindTrial processes tasks across different AI providers simultaneously (in parallel). However, when running multiple configurations from the same provider (e.g. different OpenAI models), these are processed one after another (sequentially).

> [!TIP]
> Models can use the `max-requests-per-minute` property in their run configurations to limit the number of requests made per minute.

> [!TIP]
> To automatically retry failed requests due to rate limiting or other transient errors, set `retry-policy` at the provider level to apply to all runs.
> An individual run configuration can override this by setting its own `retry-policy`:
>
> - **max-retry-attempts**: Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 0 means no retry).
> - **initial-delay-seconds**: Initial delay before the first retry in seconds.
>
> Retries use exponential backoff starting with the initial delay.

> [!TIP]
> To disable all run configurations for a given provider, set `disabled: true` on that provider.
> An individual run configuration can override this by setting `disabled: false` (e.g. to enable just that one configuration).

### tasks.yaml

This file defines the tasks to be executed on all enabled run configurations. Each task must define the following four properties:

- **name**: A unique display-friendly name to be shown in the results.
- **prompt**: The prompt (i.e. task) that will be sent to the AI model.
- **response-result-format**: Defines how the AI should format the final answer to the prompt. This can be either:
  - **Plain text format**: A string instruction describing the expected answer format (e.g., "single number", "list of words separated by commas").
  - **Structured schema format**: A JSON schema object defining the structure of the expected response for complex data (e.g., objects with specific fields and types).
- **expected-result**: Defines the accepted valid answer(s) to the prompt. The format depends on the `response-result-format` type:
  - **For plain text format**: A string value or list of string values that follow the format instruction precisely.
  - **For structured schema format**: An object value or list of object values that conform to the JSON schema definition.
Only one expected result needs to match for the response to be considered correct.

Optionally, a task can include a list of `files` to be sent along with the prompt:

- **files**: A list of files to attach to the prompt. Each file entry defines the following properties:
  - **name**: A unique name for the file, used for reference within the prompt if needed.
  - **uri**: The path or URI to the file. Local file paths and remote HTTP/HTTPS URLs are supported. The file content will be downloaded and sent with the request.
  - **type**: The MIME type of the file (e.g., `image/png`, `image/jpeg`). If omitted, the tool will attempt to infer the type based on the file extension or content.

> [!NOTE]
> If a task includes files, it will be skipped for any provider configuration that does not support file uploads or does not support the specific file type.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently supported image types include: `image/jpeg`, `image/jpg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`. Support may vary by provider.

> [!TIP]
> To disable all tasks by default, set `disabled: true` in the `task-config` section.
> An individual task can override this by setting `disabled: false` (e.g. to enable just that one task).

#### Structured Response Formats

MindTrial supports two types of response formats for tasks:

##### Plain Text Format

For tasks where the final answer can be represented as a text value:

```yaml
- name: "math problem"
  prompt: "What is 2 + 2?"
  response-result-format: "single number"
  expected-result: "4"
```

##### Structured Schema Format

For tasks requiring complex structured answers, you can define a JSON schema that describes the expected response format:

```yaml
- name: "perfect square check"
  prompt: "For each number in [4, 9, 10, 16], determine if it's a perfect square and if so, provide the square root."
  response-result-format:
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
      additionalProperties: false
      properties:
        number:
          type: integer
        is_perfect_square:
          type: boolean
        square_root:
          type: integer
      required: ["number", "is_perfect_square"]
  expected-result:
    - - number: 4
        is_perfect_square: true
        square_root: 2
      - number: 9
        is_perfect_square: true
        square_root: 3
      - number: 10
        is_perfect_square: false
      - number: 16
        is_perfect_square: true
        square_root: 4
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Structured schema format caveats:**
>
> - Semantic validation (LLM judges) cannot be used with structured schema-based response formats.
> - All expected results must be objects that conform to the same schema. For array schemas, the entire expected array must be wrapped in a single list item under `expected-result` to avoid treating each array element as a separate expected answer.
> - Models must support structured JSON response generation for reliable results.
> - The *OpenAI* provider requires JSON schemas to have `additionalProperties: false` and all fields must be required (no optional fields allowed). Other providers may be more flexible.

#### System Prompt

The system prompt controls how the response format instruction is presented to the AI model.

You can customize this template globally for all tasks in the `task-config` section, and override it for individual tasks if needed. The template uses Go's template syntax and can reference `{{.ResponseResultFormat}}` to include the task's `response-result-format`.

Default system prompt for all tasks is:

> Provide the final answer in exactly this format: {{.ResponseResultFormat}}

- **system-prompt**: A configuration section for the system prompt.
  - **template**: The template string for the system prompt instruction. If not specified, uses the default.
  - **enable-for**: Controls when system prompt should be sent to AI models. Options:
    - `"all"`: Send system prompt for all tasks (both plain text and structured schema formats).
    - `"text"`: Send system prompt only for tasks with plain text response format (default).
    - `"none"`: Do not send system prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> For structured schema response formats, the JSON schema is automatically passed to the AI model through the provider's structured response mechanism, making explicit format instructions in the system prompt optional.

#### Validation Rules

These rules control how the validator compares the model's answer to the expected results.
By default, comparisons are case-insensitive and only trim leading and trailing whitespace.

You can set validation rules globally for all tasks in the `task-config` section, and override them for individual tasks if needed; any option not specified at the task level will inherit the global setting from `task-config`:

- **validation-rules**: Controls how model responses are validated against expected results.
  - **case-sensitive**: If `true`, comparison is case-sensitive. If `false` (default), comparison ignores case.
  - **ignore-whitespace**: If `true`, all whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) is removed before comparison. If `false` (default), only leading/trailing whitespace is trimmed, and internal whitespace is preserved.
  - **trim-lines**: If `true`, trims leading and trailing whitespace from each line before comparison while preserving internal spaces within lines. CRLF line endings are normalized to LF. This option is ignored when `ignore-whitespace` is enabled. If `false` (default), lines are not individually trimmed.
  - **judge**: Optional configuration for LLM-based semantic validation instead of exact value matching.
    - **enabled**: If `true`, uses an LLM judge to evaluate semantic equivalence. If `false` (default), uses exact value matching.
    - **name**: The name of the judge configuration defined in the `config.yaml` file.
    - **variant**: The specific run variant from the judge's provider to use.

#### Judge-Based Validation

For complex or open-ended tasks where exact value matching is insufficient, you can configure LLM judges to evaluate responses semantically. This is particularly useful for creative writing, reasoning tasks, or when multiple valid answer formats exist.

**How it works:** Instead of comparing text exactly, an LLM judge evaluates whether the model's response semantically matches the expected result, considering meaning and intent rather than exact wording.

To use judge validation:

1. **Define and configure judge models in `config.yaml`:**

    ```yaml
    config:
      # ... existing configuration ...
      judges:
        - name: "mistral-judge"  # A unique name for the judge configuration.
          provider:
            name: "mistralai"
            client-config:
              api-key: "<your-api-key>"
            runs:
              - name: "fast"
                model: "mistral-medium-latest"
                max-requests-per-minute: 30
                model-parameters:
                  temperature: 0.20
                  random-seed: 847629
              - name: "reasoning"
                model: "magistral-medium-latest"
                max-requests-per-minute: 30
                model-parameters:
                  prompt-mode: "reasoning"
                  temperature: 0.20
                  random-seed: 847629
        - name: "deepseek-judge"
          provider:
            name: "deepseek"
            client-config:
              api-key: "<your-api-key>"
            runs:
              - name: "fast"
                model: "deepseek-chat"
                max-requests-per-minute: 30
                model-parameters:
                  temperature: 0.20
              - name: "reasoning"
                model: "deepseek-reasoner"
                max-requests-per-minute: 30
    ```

2. **Enable judge validation in `tasks.yaml`:**

    ```yaml
    # Enable globally for all tasks.
    task-config:
      validation-rules:
        judge:
          enabled: true
          name: "mistral-judge"
          variant: "fast"
      tasks:
        # ... tasks will use judge validation by default ...

    # Override per-task (inherit global settings and override specific options).
    task-config:
      validation-rules:
        judge:
          enabled: false  # Default: use exact value matching.
          name: "mistral-judge"
          variant: "fast"
      tasks:
        - name: "exact matching task"
          prompt: "What is 2+2?"
          response-result-format: "single number"
          expected-result: "4"
          # Inherits global validation-rules (exact value matching).
        
        - name: "creative writing task"
          prompt: "Write a short story about..."
          response-result-format: "short story narrative"
          expected-result: "A creative and engaging short story"
          validation-rules:
            judge:
              enabled: true  # Override: enable judge validation for this task.
              # Inherits name: "mistral-judge" and variant: "fast" from global config.
        
        - name: "complex reasoning task"
          prompt: "Analyze this philosophical argument..."
          response-result-format: "structured analysis with reasoning"
          expected-result: "A thoughtful analysis with logical reasoning"
          validation-rules:
            judge:
              enabled: true
              variant: "reasoning"  # Override: use reasoning run variant instead of fast.
              # Inherits name: "mistral-judge" from global config.
    ```

#### Judge Prompt Customization

MindTrial automatically applies a built-in semantic evaluation template that compares candidate responses against expected answers. For advanced use cases, you can customize the judge prompt template, response format, and acceptance criteria.

Judge prompts can be customized in the `validation-rules.judge.prompt` section of your `tasks.yaml` file, either globally in `task-config` or individually per task.

**Customization Fields:**

- **template**: Custom prompt template for the judge (supports template variables listed below).
- **verdict-format**: Expected response format from the judge (plain text instruction or JSON schema).
- **passing-verdicts**: Set of verdict values that indicate a passing evaluation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - If you provide a custom `template`, you **must** also specify both `verdict-format` and `passing-verdicts`.
> - You **cannot** override just `verdict-format` or `passing-verdicts` unless you also override the `template`.
> - All `passing-verdicts` values must conform to the `verdict-format` structure.

> [!TIP]
> The following template variables are available for judge prompts:
>
> - **{{.OriginalTask.Prompt}}**: The original task prompt
> - **{{.OriginalTask.ResponseResultFormat}}**: Format instruction from the task
> - **{{.OriginalTask.ExpectedResults}}**: Array of expected answers
> - **{{.Candidate.Response}}**: The model's response being evaluated
> - **{{.Rules.CaseSensitive}}**: Boolean case-sensitive validation flag
> - **{{.Rules.IgnoreWhitespace}}**: Boolean ignore whitespace flag
> - **{{.Rules.TrimLines}}**: Boolean trim lines flag

#### Tools

MindTrial supports tool use for tasks, allowing AI models to execute external tools during task solving. Tools are executed in sandboxed Docker containers with resource limits and network isolation.

##### Tool Definitions

Tools must be defined in `config.yaml` under the `tools` section. Each tool defines how to execute a specific capability:

- **name**: A unique name for the tool.
- **image**: Docker image to use for the tool execution.
- **description**: A detailed description of what the tool does and how to use it. This description is provided to the LLM to help it understand when and how to use the tool. Be specific and avoid ambiguity to help the LLM choose the correct tool and provide appropriate parameters.
- **parameters**: JSON schema defining the tool's input parameters. The LLM will generate the actual parameter values based on this schema. Provide comprehensive descriptions that explain parameter purpose and format.
- **parameter-files**: Mapping of parameter names to container file paths where argument values should be written. Argument values are converted to strings, non-string values are marshaled to JSON. The tool's command should read these files as needed.
- **auxiliary-dir**: Directory path inside the container where task files will be automatically mounted. If specified, copies of all files attached to the task will be mounted to this directory using each file's unique reference `name` exactly as provided. Files in this directory are reset between tool calls.
- **shared-dir**: Directory path inside the container that persists across all tool calls within a single task. If specified, files created in this directory will be available for any subsequent tool calls but will be removed when the task completes.
- **command**: Command to run inside the container. The standard output of the command execution is captured and passed back to the LLM as is.
- **env**: Environment variables to set in the container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tool use requires Docker to be installed and running on the system. Tools are executed in isolated containers with no network access by default.

Example tool definition in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
config:
  tools:
    - name: python-code-executor
      image: python:latest
      description: |
        Executes Python 3 code in a secure, sandboxed environment to perform calculations, data manipulation, or algorithmic tasks.
        IMPORTANT:
        - Only the Python standard library is available. No third-party packages (like pandas or numpy) can be imported.
        - The environment has no network access.
        - Any files mentioned in the conversation (shown as [file: filename]) are automatically mounted to /app/data/ with their exact filenames.
        - Use standard file operations like open('/app/data/filename', 'r') to read attached files, where 'filename' matches the name shown in [file: filename] references.
        - A persistent shared directory is available at /app/shared/ that persists across ALL tool calls within the same task (regardless of which tool is being called). Files created in this directory will be available in any subsequent tool call.
        - Any files or changes outside of /app/shared/ are ephemeral and will be reset between tool calls.
        - The code must print its final result to standard output to be returned.
      parameters:
        type: object
        properties:
          code:
            type: string
            description: "A string containing a self-contained Python 3 script. The script must use the `print()` function to return a final result. Example: `print(sum([i for i in range(101) if i % 2 == 0]))`. To read attached files, use open('/app/data/filename', 'r') where 'filename' matches what appears in [file: filename] references."
        required:
          - code
        additionalProperties: false
      parameter-files:
        code: /app/main.py
      auxiliary-dir: /app/data
      shared-dir: /app/shared
      command:
        - python
        - /app/main.py
      env:
        PYTHONIOENCODING: "UTF-8"
        PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1"
        PYTHONHASHSEED: "847629"
```

##### Tool Selection

You can configure tool selection globally for all tasks in the `task-config` section, and override it for individual tasks if needed. Tools must be defined in `config.yaml` first.

- **tool-selector**: Configuration for tool availability during task execution.
  - **disabled**: If `true`, no tools are available for tasks (default: `false`).
  - **tools**: List of tools to make available, with per-tool limits.
    - **name**: Name of the tool as defined in `config.yaml`.
    - **disabled**: If `true`, this tool is not available (default: `false`).
    - **max-calls**: Maximum number of times this tool can be called per task (optional).
    - **timeout**: Maximum execution time per tool call (e.g., `60s`, optional).
    - **max-memory-mb**: Maximum memory usage in MB per tool call (optional).
    - **cpu-percent**: Maximum CPU usage as percentage per tool call (optional).

Example tool configuration in `tasks.yaml`:

```yaml
task-config:
  tool-selector:
    disabled: false
    tools:
      - name: python-code-executor
        disabled: false
        max-calls: 10
        timeout: 60s
        max-memory-mb: 512
        cpu-percent: 25
  tasks:
    - name: "math calculation"
      prompt: "Calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100."
      response-result-format: "single number"
      expected-result: "2550"
      # Inherits global tool-selector configuration.
    - name: "simple math"
      prompt: "What is 2 + 2?"
      response-result-format: "single number"
      expected-result: "4"
      tool-selector:
        tools:
          - name: python-code-executor
            disabled: true  # Selectively disable tool for this simple task.
```

##### Conversation Turn Limit

You can set a maximum number of conversation turns per task to act as a safety net against infinite conversation loops (e.g., when a model repeatedly requests exhausted tools). The limit can be configured globally in the `task-config` section, and overridden for individual tasks if needed. A value of `0` means unlimited.

- **max-turns**: Maximum number of conversation turns allowed per task (default: `0`, unlimited).

Example configuration in `tasks.yaml`:

```yaml
task-config:
  max-turns: 100  # Default limit for all tasks.
  tasks:
    - name: "trivia - geography - Asia"
      prompt: "What is the capital of Japan?"
      response-result-format: "city name"
      expected-result: "Tokyo"
      max-turns: 200  # Override: allow more turns for this task.
    - name: "trivia - geography"
      prompt: "What is the capital of Australia?"
      response-result-format: "city name"
      expected-result: "Canberra"
      # Inherits the global limit of 100 turns.
```

## Live Voice Race Announcer (Claude Code)

This repository extends MindTrial with a set of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) slash commands that turn a model comparison run into a live sports-style race — complete with voice commentary narrated in real time through your speakers.

When models race in parallel, Claude wakes up on a configurable interval, reads the live eval log, writes 2–4 sentences of Ken Squier–style race commentary, speaks it aloud via [Kokoro TTS](https://github.com/nazdridoy/kokoro-tts), and appends a timestamped update to a running transcript. When the race finishes, Claude delivers a final wrap-up, writes a results summary, and automatically cancels the loop.

### Prerequisites: Kokoro TTS

The voice announcer requires [nazdridoy/kokoro-tts](https://github.com/nazdridoy/kokoro-tts), a CLI wrapper for the Kokoro speech model. It runs on ONNX Runtime (no PyTorch needed) and supports direct speaker output via `--stream`.

**1. Install the CLI:**

```bash
pip install kokoro-tts
```

**2. Download the model files (one-time, ~350 MB):**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/kokoro-tts && cd ~/.config/kokoro-tts
wget https://github.com/nazdridoy/kokoro-tts/releases/download/v1.0.0/voices-v1.0.bin
wget https://github.com/nazdridoy/kokoro-tts/releases/download/v1.0.0/kokoro-v1.0.onnx
cd -
```

**3. Point the CLI at your model files:**

```bash
export KOKORO_MODEL_DIR=~/.config/kokoro-tts
# Add to your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc) to persist across sessions.
```

**4. Verify it works:**

```bash
echo "We are LIVE! The race has begun!" | kokoro-tts - --stream --voice am_michael
```

> **Recommended voices:** `am_michael` (confident American male, used by default), `af_heart` (warm American female), `bf_emma` (British female — maximum BBC Sports energy).

### Slash Commands

All commands are Claude Code slash commands — no external infrastructure, no daemons.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/simulate-model-comparison` | Start a zero-cost simulation (generates realistic log output, no API tokens needed) |
| `/run-model-comparison` | Build and start a real MindTrial eval race |
| `/announce-model-comparison` | One tick of live commentary — meant to be called by `/loop` |
| `/stop-model-comparison` | Stop the running race and finalize the transcript |

### Usage

Both commands prompt you upfront about whether to enable the voice announcer and how often it should check in. Pass `with-announcer` to skip the question, optionally followed by an interval in minutes:

**Zero-cost simulation** (great for trying the announcer without spending API tokens):

```
/simulate-model-comparison                      # prompts about announcer + interval
/simulate-model-comparison with-announcer       # enables announcer, prompts for interval
/simulate-model-comparison with-announcer 2     # every 2 minutes, no questions asked
/simulate-model-comparison 10 2 with-announcer  # 10 tasks, 2x speed, prompts for interval
```

**Real eval race** (requires API keys configured in the eval config):

```
/run-model-comparison                           # prompts about announcer + interval
/run-model-comparison with-announcer            # enables announcer, prompts for interval
/run-model-comparison with-announcer 5          # every 5 minutes, no questions asked
/run-model-comparison config.yaml with-announcer  # .yaml config detected by suffix, not position
```

When the announcer is enabled, the loop is scheduled automatically — no need to start it manually. If you opted out, you can start it anytime:

```
/loop 1m /announce-model-comparison   # for simulation
/loop 5m /announce-model-comparison   # for real eval
```

The announcer dynamically scales how many log lines it reads based on the interval.

**Watch the transcript live in a split pane:**

```bash
tail -f results/simulation/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/*/transcript.txt
# or for real evals:
tail -f results/eval/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/*/transcript.txt
```

**Stop early:**

```
/stop-model-comparison
```

Then cancel the `/loop` in your session (type `/loop` and select cancel, or close the session).

### Eval Configs

Two pre-built eval configurations are included:

| Config | Tasks | Models |
|---|---|---|
| `config-eval-top3-cicd.yaml` | CI/CD & DevOps (CircleCI, Docker, Kubernetes, secrets, pipelines) | GPT-5.4, GPT-5.4 Pro, GPT-5.2 · Gemini 3.1 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash · Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| `config-eval-top3.yaml` | General software engineering (coding, debugging, architecture, APIs) | Same model lineup |

### Results

Each run writes output to a timestamped directory:

```
results/
├── simulation/YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS/
│   ├── eval.log          # Raw simulation log (tasks completed per model)
│   ├── transcript.txt    # Timestamped commentary transcript
│   └── results_summary.md  # Final leaderboard, average scores, notable moments
└── eval/YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS/
    ├── eval.log
    ├── transcript.txt
    └── results_summary.md
```

### Sample Transcript

```
━━━ 2026-03-17 01:52:00 (Update #1) ━━━
Gemini 2.5 Flash rockets to the front with 42 tasks complete, but Claude
Sonnet 4.6 is right on its tail at 38. GPT-5.2 sits in third, grinding
through the pack. An early rate-limit penalty hit Gemini 3.1 Pro on the
logic grid task — that could cost them down the stretch.

━━━ 2026-03-17 01:57:00 (Update #2) ━━━
Lead change! Claude Sonnet 4.6 surges past Gemini Flash into first with
67 tasks done. The Anthropic camp is rolling now...

━━━ 2026-03-17 02:08:00 — FINAL ━━━
And that is the checkered flag! Claude Sonnet 4.6 takes the win with
134 tasks completed, edging out Gemini 2.5 Flash by just 3. What a race!
```

### Keep the Session Alive for Long Runs

`/loop` is session-scoped — it stops when you exit Claude Code. For multi-hour eval runs, use tmux:

```bash
tmux new -s eval-run
claude  # start Claude Code inside tmux
# Run /run-model-comparison and /loop 5m /announce-model-comparison
# Reattach later with: tmux attach -t eval-run
```
